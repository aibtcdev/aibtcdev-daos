# Agent Account Test Plan

Based on the provided Clarity contract (`aibtc-agent-account.clar`) and the existing test files, here's a plan to update the stub test file to comprehensively test all functions:

## 1. Overall Structure

Keep the existing structure with two main describe blocks:
- `public functions: ${contractName}`
- `read-only functions: ${contractName}`

## 2. Setup and Initialization

- Add necessary imports and constants from the old test file
- Set up the contract registry and references properly
- Define helper functions for common test operations (similar to `setupAccount` in the old tests)
- Initialize the contract with pre-approved assets (SBTC, DAO token)

## 3. Public Functions to Test

### Asset Management Functions
- `deposit-stx()`: Test success case and event emission
- `deposit-ft()`: Test success case, failure with unapproved asset, and event emission
- `withdraw-stx()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission
- `withdraw-ft()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, unknown asset, and event emission
- `approve-asset()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission
- `revoke-asset()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission

### DAO Interaction Functions
- `create-action-proposal()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission
- `vote-on-action-proposal()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission
- `conclude-action-proposal()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission

### Faktory DEX Trading Functions
- `acct-buy-asset()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, unapproved DEX, and event emission
- `acct-sell-asset()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, unapproved DEX, and event emission
- `acct-approve-dex()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission
- `acct-revoke-dex()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission
- `set-agent-can-buy-sell()`: Test success case, unauthorized access, and event emission

## 4. Read-Only Functions to Test

- `is-approved-asset()`: Test with approved and unapproved assets
- `is-approved-dex()`: Test with approved and unapproved DEXes
- `get-configuration()`: Test that it returns the expected configuration

## 5. Test Scenarios to Cover

For each function, we should test:
1. **Authorization**: Ensure only authorized users can call restricted functions
2. **Success Cases**: Verify functions work as expected with valid inputs
3. **Failure Cases**: Test error handling with invalid inputs
4. **Event Emission**: Verify correct events are emitted with proper payloads

## 6. Special Considerations

- Test the agent's ability to perform actions when authorized vs. unauthorized
- Test the owner's full access to all functions
- Verify the initialization of pre-approved assets and DEXes
- Test the buy/sell permission system for the agent

## 7. Implementation Approach

1. Start with the simplest functions (deposit/withdraw)
2. Move to asset approval functions
3. Implement DAO interaction tests
4. Add DEX trading function tests
5. Finally, test read-only functions

This approach will ensure comprehensive test coverage while maintaining the existing structure and formatting of the test file.
