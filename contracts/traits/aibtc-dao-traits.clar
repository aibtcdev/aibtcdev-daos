;; the decentralized Bitflow trading pool following their xyk formula

;; can be used to buy and sell tokens until the target is reached
;; liquidity is provided by the initial minting of tokens
;; reaching the target will trigger migration to the Bitflow pool

;; a messaging contract used by the dao to send verified messages
(define-trait messaging (

;; an extension that holds funds from the DAO treasury and allows
;; the DAO to transfer rewards to users for successful proposals.
(define-trait rewards-account (

;; an extension that manages the token on behalf of the dao
;; allows for same functionality normally used by deployer through proposals
(define-trait token-owner (

    ((string-utf8 256))
    (response bool uint)
