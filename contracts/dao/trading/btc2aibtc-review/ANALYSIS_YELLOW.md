# Phase 2 Analysis: ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW Functions

This document contains the detailed analysis of functions categorized as YELLOW, following the risk-first approach outlined in `PLAN.md`.

---

## Function: `propose-allowlist-dexes`

- **Category:** ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW
- **Purpose:** Allows a designated approver to initiate a multi-signature proposal to add a new DEX, its token, and its liquidity pool to the contract's allowlist.
- **Parameters:**
    - `ft <faktory-token>`: The fungible token contract of the DEX.
    - `dex-contract <faktory-dex>`: The DEX contract itself.
    - `pool-contract <bitflow-pool>`: The associated liquidity pool contract.
- **Return Values:** `(ok proposal-id)` on success.
- **State Changes:**
    - `allowlist-proposals`: A new proposal is created and stored with a unique ID.
    - `proposal-signals`: The proposer's vote is automatically recorded as the first signal.
    - `next-proposal-id`: Incremented.
- **External Contract Calls:** None.

### Watchpoint Review

- **Access Control:** Correctly restricted to approvers via `(asserts! (is-approver tx-sender) ERR_NOT_APPROVER)`.
- **State Integrity:** The function securely creates a new proposal, setting its `proposed-at` height, initializing signals to `u1`, and storing the relevant contract principals. The logic is sound for initiating a governance action.
- **External Call Security:** N/A.
- **Overall Logic:** This is a standard and secure implementation of a proposal creation function within a multi-signature governance framework.

### Findings & Recommendations

- **Finding:** The function is implemented correctly and securely. No vulnerabilities were identified.
- **Recommendation:** No changes recommended.

## Function: `signal-allowlist-approval`

- **Category:** ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW
- **Purpose:** Allows an approver to cast a vote for an active DEX allowlist proposal. If the signal threshold is met, it automatically executes the proposal, adding the DEX to the allowlist.
- **Parameters:**
    - `proposal-id uint`: The ID of the proposal to signal.
- **Return Values:** `(ok new-signals)` on success.
- **State Changes:**
    - `proposal-signals`: Records the approver's signal to prevent duplicate voting.
    - `allowlist-proposals`: Increments the signal count and, if the threshold is met, marks the proposal as `executed: true`.
    - `allowed-dexes`: If the proposal is executed, the set of contracts is added to this map, officially allowlisting them.
- **External Contract Calls:** None.

### Watchpoint Review

- **Access Control:** Correctly restricted to approvers.
- **State Integrity:**
    - **Proposal Checks:** The function includes a robust set of assertions to ensure the proposal is valid for voting: it must exist, not be expired, not already executed, and the approver must not have already signaled.
    - **Execution Logic:** The auto-execution that occurs when `new-signals` reaches `SIGNALS_REQUIRED` is an efficient pattern. It correctly populates the `allowed-dexes` map, which is the ultimate goal of the proposal process.
- **External Call Security:** N/A.
- **Overall Logic:** The function provides a secure mechanism for the multi-signature approval and execution of governance proposals.

### Findings & Recommendations

- **Finding:** The function is implemented securely with all necessary checks for a multi-signature voting system. No vulnerabilities were identified.
- **Recommendation:** No changes recommended.
