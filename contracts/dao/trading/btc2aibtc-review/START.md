# Contract Analysis and Review

This file is our starting point. This directory is our working directory.

We will work back and forth with question then commit the changes at key milestones.

We want to perform a comprehensive review of the BTC2AIBTC trading contract.

The review will include checking the contract's logic, security features, and code quality.

## Internal Structure

For our working directory, we can create new files as needed to document our findings, questions, and code changes.

We can also create templates to fill in against each contract, e.g. a report of all functions and if they are safe, unsafe, or require further review. This could note and structure key elements such as:

- function name
- function purpose
- function parameters
- function return values
- state changes
- external contract calls

Markdown is preferred, text is king.

## Proposed Process

We should work by first eliminating GREEN or safe functions.

Then we can focus on the remaining functions that are either unsafe or require further review.

## Old Task Flow

As an example, here are some analysis points from our old tooling that we can use to guide our review:

### 🔍 Key Smart Contract Audit Watchpoints (Descending Risk Order)

#### 🔴 1. RED Functions

**High risk** — potential for theft, funds loss, or contract lock

- Who can call these functions?
- Are `tx-sender` and `contract-caller` validated correctly?
- Are side effects (transfers, locking, burning) secure?

#### 🟠 2. ORANGE Functions

**Moderate risk** — affect behavior but not critical loss vectors

- Do they have proper access controls?
- Are side effects (minting, transfers) secure?
- Are authorization checks correctly implemented?

#### 🟡 3. YELLOW Functions

**Low-to-moderate risk** — can change non-critical on-chain state

- Are they publicly callable when they shouldn’t be?
- Do they modify metadata or configuration?
- Are changes restricted to appropriate roles?

#### 🟢 4. GREEN Functions

**Low risk** — typically read-only or safe queries

- Do they _actually_ have no side effects?
- Are they correctly marked as `(read-only)`?

#### ❓ 5. Missing or Unclassified Functions

**Risk is unknown** — may escape review

- Are they truly safe or just unlisted?
- Should they fall under one of the above categories?
- Do they need deeper manual review?

#### 🧩 6. Trait-Based Function Calls

**Medium risk** — reliance on external implementations

- Are trait interfaces trusted?
- Are callers validated and constrained?
- Is fallback behavior handled?

#### 🌀 7. `as-contract` Usage

**Context risk** — unexpected behavior from context switching

- Is the context switch necessary?
- Are contract calls scoped and verified?
- Are post-call assumptions validated?

#### 🧠 8. Complex Logic

**Hidden bugs** — deeply nested or tightly coupled code

- Can logic be broken into smaller functions?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Can it be simplified or made more readable?

#### 💸 9. Fee and Token Transfer Validation

**Fund management risk** — potential for value leakage

- Are 0-value transfers prevented?
- Are fees enforced and checked?
- Are amounts verified for consistency?

#### 🛡️ 10. Input Validation

**User control risk** — potential for bad data entry

- Are all inputs (amounts, addresses, strings) checked?
- Are any unchecked user-controlled values used directly?

#### ⏸️ 11. Pause and Resume Mechanisms

**Operational risk** — contract could get stuck

- Can paused contracts be resumed?
- Are pause permissions correct?
- Is there any logic that bypasses pause state?

#### 🧪 12. Edge Cases

**Resilience risk** — uncommon scenarios causing failure

- Do corner cases break expected behavior?
- Is logic safe under re-entrancy, zero state, or max state?
