# Phase 2 Analysis: ðŸŸ  ORANGE Functions

This document contains the detailed analysis of functions categorized as ORANGE, following the risk-first approach outlined in `PLAN.md`.

---

## Function: `emergency-stop-swaps`

- **Category:** ðŸŸ  ORANGE
- **Purpose:** A critical safety function that allows any single approver to permanently halt the `swap-btc-to-aibtc` and `swap-btc-to-aibtc-legacy` functions.
- **Parameters:** None.
- **Return Values:** `(ok true)` on success.
- **State Changes:**
    - Sets the `swaps-paused` data variable to `true`.
- **External Contract Calls:** None.

### Watchpoint Review

- **Access Control:** The function is correctly restricted to principals who pass the `is-approver` check. This allows any of the 5 designated approvers to act unilaterally in an emergency.
- **State Integrity:**
    - **One-Way Flag:** The check `(asserts! (not (var-get swaps-paused)) ERR_ALREADY_DONE)` ensures the function is idempotent and that the paused state is permanent, as there is no corresponding "resume" function. This is a strong and simple design for an emergency circuit breaker.
- **External Call Security:** N/A.
- **Overall Logic:** The logic is extremely simple and serves its critical purpose effectively. It provides a swift, decentralized way for a minority of trusted parties to protect user funds if a vulnerability is discovered in the complex swap logic or its dependencies.

### Findings & Recommendations

- **Finding:** The function is a well-designed security feature. Its simplicity is its strength. No vulnerabilities were identified.
- **Recommendation:** No changes recommended.
