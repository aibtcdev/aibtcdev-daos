# Process Retrospective

This document reflects on the end-to-end process of reviewing the `btc2aibtc-bridge.clar` contract. It aims to identify successes and areas for improvement to refine our methodology for future reviews.

## What Worked Well

-   **Phased Approach:** The four-phase plan (Triage -> Function Analysis -> System Analysis -> Reporting) provided a clear, structured path from a high-level overview to detailed findings. This prevented us from getting lost in details too early.
-   **Risk-Based Triage:** Classifying functions into RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, and GREEN categories was highly effective. It allowed us to focus our attention on the most critical and complex parts of the contract first, ensuring that the highest-risk areas received the most scrutiny.
-   **Iterative, File-Based Documentation:** Creating separate, focused markdown files (`FUNCTION_TRIAGE.md`, `ANALYSIS_RED.md`, `ANALYSIS_SYSTEM.md`, etc.) was a major success. It kept our findings organized, created a clear audit trail, and allowed us to tackle one piece of the analysis at a time.
-   **Dedicated `QUESTIONS.md`:** Maintaining a running list of questions for the development team in a single file proved invaluable. It allowed us to log queries as they arose without derailing the main analysis flow.
-   **Visual Relationship Diagram:** The late addition of `ANALYSIS_RELATIONSHIPS.md` with a Mermaid.js diagram was a significant improvement. It provided immediate clarity on the contract's dependencies and their roles in the system.

## What Could Be Improved

-   **Formalize Relationship Diagramming:** The relationship diagram was created ad-hoc. It was so useful that it should be a formal, planned step rather than an afterthought.
-   **Consolidation of Analysis Files:** While the separate analysis files per color category were good for focus, they could potentially be consolidated into a single `ANALYSIS_FUNCTIONS.md` for easier navigation in the final review package. However, the current separation is also highly effective, so this is a minor point of consideration.

## Recommendations for Future Reviews

Based on this first run, the following refinements should be adopted for our standard process:

1.  **Update the `PLAN.md` Template:** The initial plan should include the creation of the `ANALYSIS_RELATIONSHIPS.md` file as a standard step in Phase 3.
2.  **Maintain the Core Structure:** The four-phase, risk-based, iterative documentation approach should be the foundation of all future contract reviews.
3.  **Continue Using Focused Files:** The use of separate files for the plan, triage, questions, analysis, and final report should be continued as a best practice.
