# Documentation Plan

This plan outlines the steps to create comprehensive functional documentation for all Clarity contracts. We will use markdown task lists to track progress.

## Phase 1: Setup and Initial Documentation

This phase focuses on establishing the process and documenting the first two priority contracts.

- [ ] **Setup: Create Documentation Template**
  - [ ] Create a generic `TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md` file for documenting Clarity contracts.
- [ ] **Setup: Create Test Script**
  - [ ] Create a script in `../tests` to identify Clarity contracts in `../contracts` that are missing corresponding documentation files in `docs/contracts`.
- [ ] **Priority Contract 1: Agent Account**
  - [ ] Create `docs/contracts/agent/aibtc-agent-account.md`
  - [ ] Document the purpose, public functions, and key interactions of the contract.
- [ ] **Priority Contract 2: Action Proposal Voting**
  - [ ] Create `docs/contracts/proposals/aibtc-action-proposal-voting.md`
  - [ ] Document the purpose, public functions, and key interactions of the contract.

## Phase 2: Full Contract Documentation

This phase involves documenting the remaining contracts. The list below is an initial assessment based on the codebase and may be adjusted.

- [ ] **Base Contracts**
  - [ ] `aibtc-base-dao.md`
- [ ] **Agent Contracts**
  - [ ] `aibtc-agent-account-config.md`
- [ ] **DAO Extension Contracts**
  - [ ] `aibtc-dao-charter.md`
  - [ ] `aibtc-dao-run-cost.md`
  - [ ] `aibtc-dao-users.md`
  - [ ] `aibtc-onchain-messaging.md`
  - [ ] `aibtc-rewards-account.md`
  - [ ] `aibtc-token-owner.md`
  - [ ] `aibtc-treasury.md`
- [ ] **Action Contracts**
  - [ ] `aibtc-action-send-message.md`
- [ ] **Swap Adapter Contracts**
  - [ ] `aibtc-bitflow-swap-adapter.md`
  - [ ] `aibtc-faktory-swap-adapter.md`

## Phase 3: Finalization and Review

- [ ] **Review and Refine:**
  - [ ] Review all generated documentation for consistency and clarity.
  - [ ] Update the root `README.md` and create `SUMMARY.md` to provide a table of contents and navigation guide.
  - [ ] Create `README.md` files for each subdirectory in `docs/contracts`.
- [ ] **Retrospective:**
  - [ ] Review the process and document lessons learned.
