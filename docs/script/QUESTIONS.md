# Questions & Clarifications

This document tracks key questions and decisions made during the development of the documentation script.

## Initial Technical Questions

1.  **LLM Interaction:**
    -   Which Python libraries should we use for file system operations and LLM interaction (e.g., `os`, `pathlib`, `requests`, `openai`)?
    -   How will the script manage API keys and other secrets for the LLM service? Should we use environment variables, a `.env` file, or another method?

2.  **Script Interface:**
    -   What should the command-line interface for the script look like?
    -   Should we include arguments for a `--dry-run` mode, processing only a `--specific-contract`, or controlling the `--model` used?

3.  **Error Handling:**
    -   How should the script handle failures, such as an LLM API error, a file not being found, or invalid Clarity code?
    -   Should it stop immediately, or log the error and continue with the next task?
