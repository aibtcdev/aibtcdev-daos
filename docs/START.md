# Documentation for aibtcdev-daos

This file is the original starting point for the documentation project. This directory is our working directory.

The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive review of the `../contracts` directory and create condensed functional documentation for developers for every Clarity `.clar` file within.

## Project Artifacts

The process and structure for this project are captured in the following files:

- **[README.md](./README.md)**: The main entry point for the developer documentation.
- **[PLANS.md](./PLANS.md)**: The detailed, step-by-step plan for creating the documentation.
- **[QUESTIONS.md](./QUESTIONS.md)**: A log of questions and decisions made during the project.
- **[Templates](./TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md)**: The templates used for generating consistent documentation (`TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md` and `TEMPLATE_TRAIT.md`).

The original "Proposed Process" and "Proposed Structure" have been moved into `PLANS.md` and are being tracked there.
