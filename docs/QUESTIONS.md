# Questions & Clarifications

This document tracks key questions and decisions made during the documentation process.

## Initial Scoping (Answered)

Before starting, we clarified the following points:

1.  **What is the depth of the review?**
    -   **Decision:** We will focus purely on creating condensed functional documentation. The goal is to describe what each contract and its public functions do, not to perform a deep security audit. We will start simple and can layer in more detail later.

2.  **What is the template strategy?**
    -   **Decision:** We will start with a single, generic `TEMPLATE_CONTRACT.md`. We will aim to follow existing patterns from the codebase (e.g., contract categories) as we create documentation.

3.  **How should we prioritize the work?**
    -   **Decision:** We will create a comprehensive plan covering all contracts but will start with two key contracts to establish our process: `agent-account` and `action-proposal-voting`.

With these points clarified, we have no further blocking questions and can proceed with the plan.
